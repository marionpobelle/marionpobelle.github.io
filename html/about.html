        <!-- ABOUT ME  -->
        <section style="width:50%; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom: 13px;">
            <h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Hello!</h3>
            <p>
                I’m a game programmer who recently graduated from ENJMIN with a <span class="text-highlight">Master in Game Programming</span>. Over the past few years, I’ve been able to work on a wide 
                variety of games with different types, platforms and technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience as a game developer started with the <span class="text-highlight">Develop At Ubisoft 2023</span> program, a <span class="text-highlight">mentorship</span> during which I was guided by a senior gameplay programmer 
                at Ubisoft Bordeaux. It was followed by an <span class="text-highlight">internship opportunity</span> to participate in a research program where I implemented a game prototype for the <span class="text-highlight">National 
                Museum of Natural History of Paris</span>. Finally at the end of my Master's, I joined <span class="text-highlight">Toe Bean Club</span> as an <span class="text-highlight">intern gameplay programmer</span>, and I am fortunate to be working with 
                them as a <span class="text-highlight">freelance game programmer  now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve worked with several different teams, made many friends, and learned several different game production processes along the way, but what makes me unique is 
                that I enjoy all of the different programming specializations and that I am not afraid to learn.
            </p>
            <h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Why is this important?</h3>
            <p>
                As a generalist, I’m <span class="text-highlight">quick to learn</span>, adapt, and leverage all of that experience to mold whatever we are making into something solid, juicy and fun. I love to try and see 
                how things can be put together in an <span class="text-highlight">efficient and scalable</span> way, and often <span class="text-highlight">ask my peers for feedback</span> to ensure my plans for implementing features fit their design.
            </p>
            <p>
                This <span class="text-highlight">desire to connect</span> makes me a better teammate and mentor. Collaborating with others motivates me because I enjoy working towards a collective goal with people. 
                I have also mentored other team members and helped them discover programming. I strive to be empathetic and serve my peers to help us all achieve greatness and have 
                fun while doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="text-highlight">I love learning new things, growing, and pouring my passion into making games.</span> I hope to keep doing it for many years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of game development, I love baking and cooking, tea, cats, books and comics, collecting DVDs, longboarding, board games, watching movies, anime and series, 
                and of course, video games!
            </p>
